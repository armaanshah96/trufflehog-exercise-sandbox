# Trufflehog Exercise

This repository is the sandbox for a workshop/demo on how to use Trufflehog and the pros/cons of using this particular secret scanner. 

Several commits expose "secrets" and using Github actions we will be able to tune our configurations of trufflehog to catch exposed secrets in our CI pipeline.
